        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Fundraising:</strong> We rally support for grassroots
            projects that bring life to local parks. From vibrant native plant
            meadows to community resources like free libraries and pantries, we
            help stewards bring their visions to life.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Advocacy:</strong> We stand behind the voices of park
            stewards, championing their ideas and ensuring their needs are heard
            in local decision-making.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Resources and Community Support:</strong> As a cooperative,
            we prioritize shared learning and collaboration. We provide tools,
            education, and connections to foster community autonomy and empower
            stewards to lead with confidence.

        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Richmond’s parks are more than open spaces—they’re places of growth,
          resilience, and connection. Native plants restore ecosystems and
          invite pollinators, while free libraries and pantries foster mutual
          aid and community care. By investing in RVA Parks Cooperative, you’re
          helping to cultivate parks that are both beautiful and vital.

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
          We envision a Richmond where every community has the autonomy to
          create and sustain parks that meet their unique needs, blending
          natural beauty with meaningful resources.

        <h2>Project Spotlight: Triangle Park</h2>
        <img src="./IMG_1166.jpeg" width="100%" />
        <p>
          In just over a year, Triangle Park has been transformed from an
          overlooked patch of grass into a native plant haven and a cornerstone
          of the Church Hill community. Neighbors united to create a space that
          is both beautiful and ecologically beneficial, stewarded with care by
          Friends of Triangle Park. From this dedicated group, RVA Parks
          Cooperative was born, recognizing the need for greater collaboration
          and support among park stewards across Richmond.
